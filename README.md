# macOS-terminal

This repo exists for configuring my macOS Terminal window across different machines. It follows the example provided by Charles Dobson's ["How To Customize Your macOS Terminal"](https://medium.com/@charlesdobson/how-to-customize-your-macos-terminal-7cce5823006e). I am use to using a bash shell. Newer versions of macOS default to zsh instead of bash. To switch type the command `chsh -s /bin/bash` within a Terminal window and restart the application. 

The Terminal theme that I like to use is *One Dark Theme* by Atom. This theme is available thanks to Nathan Buchar. Go to their [atom-one-dark-terminal](https://github.com/nathanbuchar/atom-one-dark-terminal) page for installation instructions. 

### Bash Files

In [the bash directory](/bash) there are dot bash files to use as templates. The [bash_prompt](/bash/bash_prompt.txt) file contains useful git functions for developers.
